Description: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source relational database system.
 PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system
 (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs (including
 transactions, subselects and user-defined types and functions). The
 postgresql package includes the client programs and libraries that
 you'll need to access a PostgreSQL DBMS server.  These PostgreSQL
 client programs are programs that directly manipulate the internal
 structure of PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server. These client
 programs can be located on the same machine with the PostgreSQL
 server, or may be on a remote machine which accesses a PostgreSQL
 server over a network connection. This package contains the docs     in
 HTML for the whole package, as well as command-line utilities for
 managing PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server.         If you want
 to manipulate a PostgreSQL database on a local or remote     PostgreSQL
 server, you need this package. You also need to install     this package
 if you're installing the postgresql-server package.

Description: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source relational database system. - Documentation files
 PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system
 (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs (including
 transactions, subselects and user-defined types and functions). The
 postgresql package includes the client programs and libraries that
 you'll need to access a PostgreSQL DBMS server.  These PostgreSQL
 client programs are programs that directly manipulate the internal
 structure of PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server. These client
 programs can be located on the same machine with the PostgreSQL
 server, or may be on a remote machine which accesses a PostgreSQL
 server over a network connection. This package contains the docs     in
 HTML for the whole package, as well as command-line utilities for
 managing PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server.         If you want
 to manipulate a PostgreSQL database on a local or remote     PostgreSQL
 server, you need this package. You also need to install     this package
 if you're installing the postgresql-server package.   This package
 contains documentation.
